# Provably fair example

A provably fair example build with express, and plain javascript.

### What is **provably fair**

A provably fair algorithm allows users to check and analyze the legitimacy of every roll and confirm that the server/house did not alter them in their favor. By using a provably fair algorithm to generate random numbers neither players nor the operator of the site can know the result of the game before it starts.
